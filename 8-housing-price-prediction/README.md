## Descreption:
The purpose of this project is to predict housing prices using a dataset of house specifications.
### - Dataset
The database in this project was randomly created by the `Make Random House.cpp` file.
You can use this file to create new datasets for yourself or use the `house-3.csv` datasets.
In the `Make Random House.cpp` file, neighborhoods `a` have a higher priority than neighborhoods `b` and neighborhoods `b` have a higher priority than neighborhoods `c`.
These neighborhoods are stored in arrays a, b, c.

You can also use real datasets. Real datasets need to be checked, Because similar houses may have a big price difference, And this may lead to incorrect network learning.
