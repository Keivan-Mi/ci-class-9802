# About:
Breast Cancer prediction is a tool to find out cancer in Microscopic pictures.

# Description:
After searching on internet we learned Deep learning. We downloaded datasets from the website which Name is Kaggle and we used json file(https://www.kaggle.com/).We added some library. After downloading and adding these requirements, We started coding. We have a list of pictures and a list of (1,0) to show whether there is a breast cancer or not.



# The Library:
-Os
-Copy
-Glob
-Fnmatch
-Time
-Numpy
-Pandas
-Cv2
-Random
-Seaborn
-Matplotlib
-Train_test_split
-Classification_report
-Condusion_matrix
-Torch and its other methods
